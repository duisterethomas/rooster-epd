# Rooster-EPD V3
With this you can show your Zermelo schedule on an E-Paper display.

# Instructions incomplete!!!
I might write these instructions later, but I'm not sure since as far as I know i'm the only user and it will probably remain that way because the Rooster-EPD V3 costs more than â‚¬50,- which is pretty costly. However the code for V3 is completely functional, so I have made a release to prevent the update checker popup from showing up.
